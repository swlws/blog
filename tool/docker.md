# Docker Overview

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. 



## The Docker platform[ðŸ”—](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#the-docker-platform)

Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers:

- Develop your application and its supporting components using containers.
- The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application.
- When youâ€™re ready, deploy your application into your production environment, as a container or an orchestrated service. This works the same whether your production environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid of the two.

## What can I use Docker for?

* **Fast, consistent delivery of your applications**

* **Responsive deployment and scaling**
* **Running more workloads on the same hardware**

## Docker architecture

Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker *client* talks to the Docker *daemon*, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon *can* run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.

### The Docker daemon

The Docker daemon (`dockerd`) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.

### The Docker client

The Docker client (`docker`) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as `docker run`, the client sends these commands to `dockerd`, which carries them out. The `docker` command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.

### Docker registries

A Docker *registry* stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry.

When you use the `docker pull` or `docker run` commands, the required images are pulled from your configured registry. When you use the `docker push` command, your image is pushed to your configured registry.

### Docker objects

When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects. 

#### IMAGES

An *image* is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. .Often, an image is *based on* another image, with some additional customization.

To build your own image, you create a *Dockerfile* with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it.

#### CONTAINERS

A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.

 When a container is removed, any changes to its state that are not stored in persistent storage disappear.

##### Example `docker run` command

The following command runs an `ubuntu` container, attaches interactively to your local command-line session, and runs `/bin/bash`.

```
$ docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
```

When you run this command, the following happens (assuming you are using the default registry configuration):

1. If you do not have the `ubuntu` image locally, Docker pulls it from your configured registry, as though you had run `docker pull ubuntu` manually.
2. Docker creates a new container, as though you had run a `docker container create` command manually.
3. Docker allocates a read-write filesystem to the container, as its final layer. This allows a running container to create or modify files and directories in its local filesystem.
4. Docker creates a network interface to connect the container to the default network, since you did not specify any networking options. This includes assigning an IP address to the container. By default, containers can connect to external networks using the host machineâ€™s network connection.
5. Docker starts the container and executes `/bin/bash`. Because the container is running interactively and attached to your terminal (due to the `-i` and `-t` flags), you can provide input using your keyboard while the output is logged to your terminal.
6. When you type `exit` to terminate the `/bin/bash` command, the container stops but is not removed. You can start it again or remove it.

## What is a container?[ðŸ”—](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#what-is-a-container)

Simply put, a container is simply another process on your machine that has been isolated from all other processes on the host machine. 

## What is a container image?

When running a container, it uses an isolated filesystem. This custom filesystem is provided by a **container image**. Since the image contains the containerâ€™s filesystem, it must contain everything needed to run an application - all dependencies, configuration, scripts, binaries, etc. The image also contains other configuration for the container, such as environment variables, a default command to run, and other metadata.
